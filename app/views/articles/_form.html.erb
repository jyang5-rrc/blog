<%# The full_messages_for method returns an array of user-friendly error messages for a specified attribute. If there are no errors for that attribute, the array will be empty. %>

<%# In new.html.erb file, we use the @article instance variable to create a form for a new article.
In the _form.html.erb file, we use the article local variable to create a form for a new article.
This is because the _form.html.erb file is a partial, and partials don't have access to instance variables.
Instead, they use local variables, which are passed to them from the view that renders them.
In this case, the new.html.erb file is rendering the _form.html.erb file, and it's passing the article local variable to it.
 This is why we use the article local variable in the _form.html.erb file. %>

<%# A partial's filename must be prefixed with an underscore, e.g. _form.html.erb. But when rendering, it is referenced without the underscore, e.g. render "form". %>
